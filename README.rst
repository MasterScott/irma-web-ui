 IRMA - Web Interface

Overview

This directory stores everything related to the web interface on top of IRMA.

-----------------------

============
Installation
============

Here are the few steps needed to get the interface up and running

**1. Make sure you have node installed**

Node is needed to fetch the dependencies (npm for the server side, bower for the client side), and to launch the task runner (gulp).
You can get it from many ways, choose the one that suits you better on their website:  `nodeJs`_.


**2. Install the development tools**

Those two work better when installed globally, you may need root privileges to install them this way

.. code-block:: bash

    $ npm install -g bower gulp

**3. Fetch the dependencies**

The rest of the dependencies can them be fetched with this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ npm install

If everything went fine, ``bower`` and the ``webdriver-manager`` should launch their respectiv updates right after ``npm install`` is done.
If not, here they are:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bower install
    $ webdriver-manager update

Usage

------------
Tests
------------

There are 3 steps that can check code integrity:

**Linting**

.. code-block:: bash

    $ gulp lint

**Unit tests**

.. code-block:: bash

    $ gulp unit

**End to end tests**

These tests need to access the interface through a web server, so you will have to launch one.
There is a standalone server embeded in the project, just launch it in another shell with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ # In another shell
    $ npm start

The end to end tests can then be checked with another gulp task:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ gulp e2e

------------------

You can launch those 3 in sequence with the ``full`` task. You will need the standalone server running for the E2E tests.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ gulp full


------------
Build
------------

To get a bundled and prod ready version of the interface, use the ``dist`` task, which will build a ``dist`` directory.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ gulp dist

.. _nodeJs: http://nodejs.org/
